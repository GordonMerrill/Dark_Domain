3.0 Gameplay and Mechanics

3.1 run around and kill the enemies advancing on your domain.
	
3.1.1 for every wave you defeat the enemies become stronger and more numerous.
		
3.1.2 you just survive until you are powerful enough to conquer the world or die before you can.
		
3.1.3 No puzzles so far.
		
3.1.4 the objective of the game is expanding your domain and survive until you have built up enough power to conquer the world.
    
3.1.5 the game flows nice and smooth between the waves. After every wave there is a base building phase before the next one comes. You can slowly expand your domain through sacrificing mob drops to all seeing towers.
  
3.2 Mechanics
	
3.2.1 Knockback physics and weight
		
3.2.2 there is varied movement options from dashing/walking to short range blinks.
		
3.2.3 inbetween waves during the prep phase you can build/move buildings as well as harvest resource nodes.
		
3.2.4 you can build structures, interact with and upgrade your various towers and buildings. As well as harvest various resources and interact with special buildings to get special bonuses.
    
3.2.5 the combat is a mix of melee and ranged attacks based off what weapons or spells you have equipped, influenced mainly by your stats and equipment and what skill tree you're specked into. There are also dodges which cost stamina or mana based off of which tree you are specialized in.
    
3.2.6 the economy would be the souls you harvest from enemies as well as the resources that you collect from the nodes across the map.
    
3.2.7 simple Ui. (will have a better idea at a later date.)
		
3.3 not really any options that affect gameplay
	
3.4 as a roguelike you are meant to die multiple times and restart the game. Earning a currency that you can use to upgrade yourself in the “menu”
